# Snake Game in Python with Linked List

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the `pygame` library. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eats food, and grows longer. The snake's movement is controlled by arrow keys, and the game ends if the snake collides with the boundary or itself.

## Features

- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- Food randomly appears on the screen for the snake to eat.
- The snake grows longer every time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary or itself.
- Scorekeeping and level progression can be added as extensions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have `pygame` installed. You can install it using pip:
